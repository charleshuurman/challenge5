# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description

The Work Day Scheduler is a simple, intuitive tool designed to help users keep track of their daily commitments

- **Motivation**  
The aim was to create an easy-to-use tool to simplify daily planning. 

- **Why did you build this project?**   
I noticed that while there are many calendar apps available, few focus solely on the workday itself. By creating a tool centered on standard work hours, users can more efficiently plan their tasks without unnecessary clutter.

- **What problem does it solve?** 
This project offers a quick-glance solution for time management during standard business hours, making it easier to allocate time and prioritize tasks.

- **What did you learn?** 
I learned some skills in jQuery, DOM traversal, I practiced the local storage manipulation, and integrated third-party libraries like Day.js.
